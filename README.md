## 🚦 Task 4 – Road Traffic Accident Analysis (India)

This repository contains Python code for analyzing Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) in India using the RTA_Dataset.csv file.
The project focuses on identifying accident patterns, analyzing contributing factors, and generating visualizations for insights into road safety.

## 📊 Dataset
File: data/RTA_Dataset.csv

## Description: This dataset contains details of road traffic accidents in India, including:
1.Accident severity
2.Number of vehicles involved
3.Road surface conditions
4.Weather and light conditions
And more...
